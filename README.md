# Dungeon Raiders

Dungeon Raiders is a text based rpg adventure game that requires players to play strategically and tactifully face every enemy encounter. It makes use of a turn based fighting system in which both the enemy and the player make their turns one after the other. This game was a challenge to recreate the feeling of older retro text based games whilst only using java as my medium. Currently the game allows players to by equipment and upgrade their overall stats but in future I want to implement more weapon and armour choice as well as add a system for local and online game saves.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17+ (works with most modern JDKs/IDEs)
- Optional: NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse

## Compile and Run

From the project’s src root (so the dungeon_raiders folder is visible):

`# Compile
javac rpg_game/RPG_GAME.java

# Run (note the package-qualified name)
java rpg_game.RPG_GAME`
